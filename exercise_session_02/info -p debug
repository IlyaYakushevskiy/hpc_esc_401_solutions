    entropy data as often encountered in space imaging instrument data
    or numerical model output from weather or climate simulations.
    While floating point representations are not directly supported,
    they can also be efficiently coded by grouping exponents and
    mantissa. ***************** SZIP compatibility
    *********************** Libaec includes a free drop-in replacement
    for the SZIP library (http://www.hdfgroup.org/doc_resource/SZIP).
    Just replace SZIP's shared library libsz.so* with libaec.so* and
    libsz.so* from libaec. Code which is dynamically linked with SZIP
    such as HDF5 should continue to work with libaec. No
    re-compilation required. HDF5 files which contain SZIP encoded
    data can be decoded by HDF5 using libaec and vice versa.
